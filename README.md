"MovieGoer is an expansive movie suggestion app- dedicated to transporting you back in time to experience a movie and surrounding culture."

"Choose a topic or genre and get a list of 20th Century movies. You'll get to see what major world events occured when the movie released, as well who the top billboard artist of that year was - all to help immerse you in what the culture must have felt like at the time."


"MovieGoer is built on a vast relational database using API data from the International Movie Database to provide you recommendations. This would not be possible without IMDB's great wealth of recorded knowledge."
